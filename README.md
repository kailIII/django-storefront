Storefront takes code ideas and structure from the following projects.

* Zinnia
* Satchmo
* Django-Shop
* Satchless
* a few others.

Currently, nothing in the project works properly yet, other than the models to set up categories and items. The eventual goal with this project is not to create a framework or API, but a fully functional app that can be easily skinned.

Required Dependencies so far
